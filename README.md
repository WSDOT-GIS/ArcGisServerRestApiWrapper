# ArcGIS Server REST API Wrapper #

This library provides a wrapper around the [ArcGIS Server REST API](http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/apis/rest/index.html).  Note that not all operations have been implemented.  Operations will be added to the library on an as-needed basis.  (When the author needs to use an operation, it will be added.)

## Unit Tests ##
You will need to add a valid `ClientId` and `ClientSecret` value to the app.config file. This file is omitted from the repository.
